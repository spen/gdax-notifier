# GDAX Notifier ðŸ“ˆðŸ””

GDAX Notifier runs in your terminal and keeps a close watch on your on your open trades.
When it sees a trade that's been filled it'll notify you via the Notification Centre like so:

It's also aware of other changes to your trades (additions, cancellations, part-fills) and will print a summary of those changes in the terminal:

### Configuring GDAX

In order to keep an eye on your orders, GDAX Notifier needs Authorized API access to your account.
This access is given via 3 parameters: An API key, an API secret and the pass-phrase associated with that API key, more on which you can read about [here](https://docs.gdax.com/#authentication).

You can generate the API key, secret and pass-phrase at [gdax.com/settings/api](https://www.gdax.com/settings/api). This app only requires 'View' permissions, so it's recommended that you select 'View' when generating the key to be used here.
This app expects these details to be found in a file named `__c.js` and in a particular format...

 - First, generate your API key (View only recommended)
 - Then create a new file in the root of the project, named `__c.js` with the command: `touch __c.js` 
 - Next, open this file and format it like so, replacing the placeholders with values generated through GDAX:
```js
module.exports = ( {
	KEY: 'Your API key',
	SECRET: 'Your API secret',
	PASSPHRASE: 'Your API pass-phrase',
	USE_SANDBOX: false,
} );
```
